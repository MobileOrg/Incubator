* Integration of SwiftOrg & New Core Data Model

** Integration of SwiftOrg

   [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/swift-org][SwiftOrg]] is a parser for Org-mode files.
   
   Usage of [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/swift-org][SwiftOrg]] is pretty straightforward. As it is not connected
   to a persistence layer it is necessary to wrap it into an
   additional parser. The additional wrapping makes it easy to extract
   currently unsupported keywords or markups like SCHEDULD (xiaoxinghu/swift-org#4) or only
   partially supported items like notes (xiaoxinghu/swift-org#3).

   As [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/swift-org][SwiftOrg]] is actively developed I would recommend to use it as
   the parser for a future version of MobileOrg.

** New Core Data Model

   To allow a more dynamic UI a seems necessary. 
   This is the model which was used to play with SwiftOrg. A
   another PoC with different Views on the data has to be established
   to get proper results.
