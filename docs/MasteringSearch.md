# Mastering Search

MobileOrg provides a powerful full-text search, as well as
property-based searches for keywords and tags.

## Defining your search

The search bar allows you to enter in a string of text to search
for. MobileOrg searches for this entire phrase. OR combinations are
currently not supported. MobileOrgâ€™s search capability is
case-INsensitive.

Beneath the search bar are several scope buttons.

Choosing All performs a full-text search of the following:

- Node title and body text
- Tags
- Keywords (such as TODO or DONE)

Choosing an option other than *All* narrows the search to one of the
above categories.
