# Browsing your Org files

MobileOrg tries to make it easy to manage Org files both large and
small.

## Walking the hierarchy

Clicking on the text of a node in the Outline view will drill you down
one level deeper into the tree and display that node’s children. To go
back to the node you were previously viewing, click the back-arrow
button in the upper left corner.

If the node you click on has no children, its details page will be
displayed instead. See the next section for more information.

## Viewing node details

To view the details for any node, click on the blue disclosure icon on
the right of the cell. The details page shows the node title and full
body text.

## Action Menu

The Action Menu is a context-sensitive menu that allows you to perform
actions on nodes, such as marking them as done or viewing them as HTML
documents. To bring up the Action Menu, touch and hold your finger on
any node’s title text in the Outline view. The Action Menu will slide
up and present you with several action buttons.

## Document view

While the Outline tree is very useful to quickly browse the outline
and find a particular node, it is not the best representation as far
as readability of notes is concerned, because the headlines and the
body text are structurally separated. For reading, MobileOrg has a
Document View which shows an HTML representation of an entire file or
subtree, rooted at whatever level you choose to open it at. Document
View can be accessed through the Action Menu, or from the details page
of a node.
