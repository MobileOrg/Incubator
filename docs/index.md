# User Documentation

##Getting Started

MobileOrg uses a WebDAV server or Dropbox to interact with your
Org-files. It downloads Org files from the server, and uploads
captured notes to a mobileorg.org file on the same server. The
documentation below covers how to get started using Dropbox or set up
a WebDAV account (using free services or your own server), how to
download and finally browse Org-files stored on your device.

Be sure to install MobileOrg prior to following these guides. You can
find MobileOrg in the App Store on your device by searching for
MobileOrg.
